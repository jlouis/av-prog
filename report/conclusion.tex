\chapter*{Conclusion}

In this project we have
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented a fast interpreter for UM specification.
\item Implemented a parsec-based parser for the SEL language.
\item Implemented a non-working compiler from SEL to 2d.
\item Implemented a complex code layouter for 2d.
\item Provided operational semantics for 2d and O'cult.
\item Analyzed an alternative code layouter.
\item Analyzed an alternative CPS-based compiler tool chain.
\end{itemize}

As it has been made clear by our report, we have not been able to get
a entirely working system up and running. However, we have clearly
made headway, and it is likewise clear that with more time we would
have been able to implement the SEL. Our primary difficulty has not surprisingly been the implementation of the layout system and the
compiler, whose implementation we deferred too long. We believe that
it is possible to get a compiler to a working state if one uses the
alternative CPS-based idea and rewrote the compiler to use it. We
estimate this can be done with a couple of days work, but we do not
have the time to do this.

\paragraph{Lessons for the future}
In the future it would seem to be best to start with a very small
language, and then work upwards from that.
